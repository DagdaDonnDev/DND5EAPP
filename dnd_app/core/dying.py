"""Hit points, dying and death -- the rules both apps follow.

Damage, death saving throws, becoming stable and dying all happen here,
so the desktop sheet and the Android sheet can't tell two different
stories about the same character. Each app only does its own screen work
(spin boxes, toasts, the YOU DIED overlay) with what these return.

The rules (PHB p.197-198):
  * Temporary hit points soak damage first.
  * Massive damage: when damage drops you to 0 HP and the damage LEFT
    OVER is at least your hit point maximum, you die outright.
  * At 0 HP you're unconscious and roll death saves: 3 successes and
    you're stable, 3 failures and you die.
  * Taking damage at 0 HP is a failed death save. A stable creature that
    takes damage stops being stable and starts rolling again.
  * Stable means still at 0 HP and still unconscious -- you regain 1 HP
    after 1d4 hours (the player heals 1), or sooner if someone heals you.
  * Any healing at 0 HP wakes you and resets the death saves.

How the state is kept (all of it saved with the character):
  * char["death_saves"] = {"successes": n, "failures": n}
  * stable = 0 HP and 3 successes ticked (they stay ticked until you wake)
  * char["is_dead"] = True once dead, until Revive
