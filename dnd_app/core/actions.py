Action Abilities module.

Builds the Combat tab's Action/Bonus Action/Reaction/Passive cards for
a character: the KNOWN_ACTIONS reference catalog of class/subclass/
feat/race/magic-item abilities, plus build_action_abilities(), which
filters that catalog against a character's actual class levels,
subclass, known feats, race, and equipped/attuned items and returns
only the entries that genuinely apply. Extracted from ui/sheet.py so
combat action cards stay maintainable outside the CharacterSheet
monolith.
