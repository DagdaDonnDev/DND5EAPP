"""Immersive Health and Immersive Exhaustion -- the character sheet showing
how the character is doing, the same way on both apps.

  Immersive Health      colour drains from the sheet as hit points drop:
                        none at full HP, barely any after a scratch, about
                        half of it near 0, and it comes back as they heal.
  Immersive Exhaustion  a dark frame closes in from the edges of the
                        screen, one step per level of exhaustion, and the
                        page shrinks to fit inside it. (Level 6 is death,
                        which has its own screen.)

The numbers are untouched -- the effects only add to what the sheet
already says. Each is a setting, kept with the app's other settings:
  Full     the whole effect; the frame's dark blur reaches into the page
  Reduced  half the colour fade; the frame stays in the page's margin, so
           no text is ever under the darkness
  Off      nothing

Everything here is plain rules and numbers, except render_frame(), which
draws the frame with Qt's QtGui (imported only when it's called, so the
rest of core never needs Qt) -- both apps show the identical frame.
