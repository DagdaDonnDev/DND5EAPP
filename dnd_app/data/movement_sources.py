"""
Central catalog of sources that grant a character a swim, climb, or fly
speed beyond plain walking — racial traits (passive) and class features
(passive or toggle-driven, same active_effects mechanism as
resistance_sources.py). Multiple sources of the SAME movement type don't
add together (a character with two "swim 30" sources doesn't swim 60) —
the resolver in calculator.py takes the highest value per type.
