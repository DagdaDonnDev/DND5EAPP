Creature stat blocks — mounts, companions, summoned creatures, and Wild
Shape beast forms. Merged from four formerly-separate files
(mount_statblocks.py, companions.py, summon_spells.py, wildshape_beasts.py)

# Helm/Oars/Sails/Weapons/Naval-Ram component breakdown as traits).
# Land vehicles (Cart, Carriage, Chariot, Sled, Wagon): no core PHB/DMG/
# Ghosts of Saltmarsh source gives these any AC/HP at all — the combat
# stats here come from a supplementary alternate vehicle-rules table
# (distinct from, and not fully consistent with, core 5e content) rather
# than an official WotC sourcebook. Cost/weight for these still live in
# ADVENTURING_GEAR (items.py) using the official PHB figures, since this
# alternate table's weight values conflict with those and PHB takes
# priority for that specific data.
