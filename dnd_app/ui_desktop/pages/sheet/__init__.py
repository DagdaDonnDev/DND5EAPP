"""Character Sheet package.

CharacterSheet is composed from per-domain mixins (one file per tab/
concern) rather than living as one 12,000-line class. Every mixin
shares one real `self`/QWidget instance, so a method in one file can
freely call `self._build_statblock_card(...)` etc. even though that
method is defined in a different mixin's file; Python resolves it via
the composed class's MRO at runtime, not via imports between the mixin
files themselves.
