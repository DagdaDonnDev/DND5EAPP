"""Save/Load screen bridge. Reuses dnd_app.core.save_load's JSON
format and validation wholesale -- a character saved on desktop opens
fine on Android and vice versa, since it's the same file format. That
sharing is deliberate and stays that way: core/save_load.py and
core/pdf_sheet.py hold the one serialization/PDF-export
implementation for both platforms, so the JSON schema and the PDF
output can never drift apart between them. What's platform-specific
(this file, vs. ui_desktop's save/export dialogs) is only the
"where do the bytes come from/go" plumbing -- default folder
resolution, native file pickers, content:// URI handling -- which is
exactly the split already in place, not something to unify further.

Where characters live: both apps save to a "MIMIC Characters" folder in
the shared Documents folder by default (core.save_load.get_save_dir), or
a folder picked in Settings. On Android that's shared storage
(/storage/emulated/0/Documents/...), which the Files app can browse and
the app can write without a permission on Android 11+; older versions
fall back to the app's private Documents folder, where saves used to
live -- those are copied across once on first launch. Exports go into a
folder per character beside the saves. A folder picked in Settings has
to be one Android lets apps write to (Documents or Download).

Loading FROM elsewhere (e.g. a file the player downloaded into their
phone's Downloads folder) goes through loadCharacterFromUrl() below,
fed by a QML native file picker (Qt.labs.platform.FileDialog), which
uses Android's Storage Access Framework itself for the picker UI even
though writing through SAF isn't implemented here. A file picked that
way can come back as either a plain filesystem path or a "content://"
URI depending on Android version/provider -- content:// URIs aren't
real paths Python's open() can read, so that branch goes through Qt's
own QFile (which has a content:// resolver on Android) instead. THIS
BRANCH IS UNTESTED -- there's no real Android device in this sandbox,
only the offscreen/desktop QPA platform, where every picked file is a
plain local path and that branch never runs.
