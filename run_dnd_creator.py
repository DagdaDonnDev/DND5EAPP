# (which imports nothing but PySide6 itself) BEFORE importing main_window,
# which transitively pulls in every game-data module (classes, races, feats,
# spells, magic items, subclass features, etc.) plus the full sheet/wizard
# UI code. That heavy import is what was actually taking the 5-12 seconds
# users were seeing as a frozen window before anything appeared on screen —
# moving it to AFTER the splash is already visible fixes that directly,
# rather than just making the heavy part itself faster.
